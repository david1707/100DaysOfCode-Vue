### Day 80

Instead of fetching the data from an API to store the result into a computed variable, now it is stored in Vuex.

Added functionality to change from "Post approved" to "Post pending" and vice-versa on double click

Added search: Type a text in the input and it will show the posts containing that text in the title or body
