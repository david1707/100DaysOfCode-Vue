### Day 79

New project: Vue_api

Started this new Vue project to learn how to properly intertwine Vue, Vuex and API calls.

On components, I'll use Vuex Actions to perform calls to an API with axios, then store the data on Vuex via Mutations.

Right now, I'm fetching data from an API via Axios as a service, and store it into a component variable.

Next steps will be to move that logit to Vuex, so Vuex will fetch the data via action, and store the received data into the state via mutations
